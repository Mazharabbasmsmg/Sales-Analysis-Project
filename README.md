Sales Analysis Project: This project analyzes sales data to answer four key questions: 1) What city generated the most sales? 2) Which items are usually sold together? 3) Which month did the company make its highest revenue? 4) What time should the company display its adverts to maximize sales? The project uses Python and data visualization tools to explore and visualize the data, and provides insights that can help the company optimize its sales strategy. The code and visualizations in this repository can be used as a starting point for further analysis and decision-making
